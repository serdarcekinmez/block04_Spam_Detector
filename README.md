Spam Detector Project

Project Overview:
This project showcases the development of a machine learning model that effectively identifies and distinguishes between spam and non-spam messages. 
Utilizing a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we transformed text data into a format that our model could learn from. 
A Jupyter notebook called Spam_Detector_Project.ipynb contains all the code and detailed explanation.

Project Presentation:
Watch our project presentation on this link. Here we talk in-depth about the methodology, the results, and the insights we gathered.

Results:
Our model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99%, with a precision of 100% for classifying non-spam and 95% for spam classification. The recall was 99% for non-spam and 97% for spam. This high performance indicates that our model is reliable and effective in filtering out spam messages while minimizing the chances of misclassifying legitimate messages as spam. The f1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was also high, signifying a well-balanced model.
